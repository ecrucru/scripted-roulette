<h1 id="chap_intro">Introduction to Scripted Roulette</h1>
	<p><strong>Scripted Roulette</strong> is an original application which helps you to develop and analyze new betting strategies for the casino game 'Roulette' from a mathematical perspective.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_story">Story</h2>
		<p>The roulette has the reputation to be easily beaten, but it is mostly an impression since the mathematical expected value is negative by design: around -2.70% for the French roulette (one zero) and -5.26% for the American roulette (two zeros) and around -8% for the Mexican roulette (three zeros). Coupled to a maximum amount per round, the roulette is by definition <em>statistically</em> and <em>generally</em> favorable to the casinos.</p>
		<p>However, it doesn't tell that you can't win. You just need some luck and an adjusted strategy. The roulette is one of the most attractive games in the casinos thanks to the physical randomness of the wheel which avoids any computer-based controls. Its disadvantage is that the luck is local and is not <em>equally</em> distributed among the casinos of the same brand.</p>
		<p>The application aims to give the player a new vision of the game and a tool to develop new strategies. It can also serve to validate the marketing arguments of some irregular websites which try to convince you that you will easily win. Don't believe them unless you know what the applicable conditions are, especially the identity of the pseudorandom number generator. Is it forged? How can we prove it?</p>

	<h2 id="sect_promises">Promises</h2>
		<p><strong>Scripted Roulette</strong> is a pure mathematical engine which normally doesn't hinder the capability of a user to win. If you write a script with no mistake and if the current version of the software is able to process it with no bug, then you can expect to experience the roulette like never before.</p>
		<p>The scripting language is inspired from the BASIC and Assembly languages in order to have very simple commands that can be run in loops and conditionally. By embedding several pseudorandom number generators ("PRNG") and a parser of mathematical expressions, the application can simulate your game with different levels of reliability and randomness. Finally, it can tell you if you are developing (or not) a winning strategy!</p>
		<p>If you feel confident, you can refer to the delivered demos to reverse-engineer them and to understand rapidly the logic of the scripting language. If not, you can simply follow this documentation to learn progressively the wildest details of the application.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_example">Example</h2>
		<p>The objective of this documentation is to give you all the clues to create simple scripts.</p>
		<p>The following one consists in generating numbers for the roulette. For more complex examples, you have to refer to the provided demos.</p>

		<p>Let's start and have fun!</p>


<h1 id="chap_tech">Technical information for the developers</h1>
	<p>This section helps to understand how the application can be compiled from its sources. This section is then not relevant for final users playing with the delivered binaries of the application. You can jump to the <a href="#chap_basics">next chapter</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_git">Get your copy with Git</h2>
		<p>You can get the source code from the files repository at SourceForge.net but you can also use Git directly.</p>
		<p>Git is a popular versionning tool which allow to keep a trace of the evolution of the source code (read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" rel="nofollow">more on Wikipedia</a>). A server is available at SourceForge to get the essential files. Open Git Bash and run this command from the folder of your choice:</p>
		<p class="Code">git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/scripted-roulette/code scripted-roulette-code</p>
		<p>The hosting is done at SourceForge for historical reasons. You will find a file repository, some space for the website and the versionned files with Git. That's sufficient to deliver to you the application safely.</p>
		<p>The Git repository is composed of one branch named "MASTER". It contains only the latest files currently released. The absence of a trunk is not a problem: the commits occur only when the files contain an important tested feature.</p>
		<p>The sole inconvenient is that it is not so easy to manage pull requests. Alternatively, you can post a patch/diff file on the <a href="#chap_contrib">support page</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_compilers">Tested compilers</h2>
		<p><strong>Scripted Roulette</strong> is available on any platform supporting C++ and wxWidgets 2.8.12/3.0.x. An effort has been made to maximize the compatibility of the application with the different branches of wxWidgets and the compilers you may use.</p>
		<p>The following table sums up the different tested configurations and which supported configurations will be used if you submit a <a href="#chap_contrib">ticket</a>:</p>

	<h2 id="sect_dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
		<p>We assume that you first successfully compiled wxWidgets 2.8.12 or wxWidgets 3.0.2 by following the official documentation available at <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wxwidgets.org</a>.</p>
		<p>Then you have to download wxEcMath v0.6.5 (at least) in the sub-folder &quot;src/wxEcMath&quot;. This library is not expected to be shared, but included in your projects. You can download the software online to be sure to always get the latest stable and supported version.</p>
			<ul><li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxecmath/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxecmath/</a></li></ul>
		<p>If you enable the option to use Scintilla (see below) in order to highlight the syntax of your upcoming scripted roulettes, then you can use the standard class wxStyledTextCtrl.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In wxWidgets 2.8.12, you will find it in the &quot;contrib&quot; folder under the name &quot;stc&quot;. You simply have to compile the project with the provided makefile and add the generated OBJ files to your project.</li>
				<li>In wxWidgets 3.0.x, you have to enable &quot;wxUSE_STC=1&quot; during the build. Then the class can be used and linked automatically.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Other external resources have been adapted in the source code directly and don't need further action. Refer to the <a href="#chap_license">licenses</a> to know more about what you can do with it.</p>
		<p>The pseudorandom number generators are optimized to be compiled with a 32-bit instruction set. However, they will mostly be used in the range starting from 0 and ending to 38.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_sysvars">System variables</h2>
		<p>For the document, we will name the following variables:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>path</td>
					<td>The directories where you can find all your executable files to be used with command lines. It is generally redefined automatically when you install a new application.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>wxwin</td>
					<td>The root directory of wxWidgets.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>bccpath</td>
					<td>The root directory of Borland C++ Compiler.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>The value of each variable is represented between two percent signs.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_project">Configuration of your project files</h2>
		<p>Scripted Roulette is not shipped with already configured workspaces as there are so many editors available on the market. This section aims to explain how to create one project.</p>

		<h3 id="para_paths">Paths</h3>
			<p>Under Linux, most paths and makefiles are automatically provided with a shell script named &quot;configure&quot;.</p>
			<p>But if you are under Windows, your project must include some paths. With Visual C++, they are defined in the options. With Borland C++, you have to edit some configuration files *.CFG (refer to its installation path) stored as a plain text.</p>

			<p>With wxWidgets 2.8.12, to be able to link with the contributed wxStyledTextCtrl that you compiled, you have to include the OBJ files in your project. You can locate the files in the sub-folders of &quot;%wxmsw%\contrib\build\stc&quot;. If Microsoft Visual Studio tells that there are duplicated OBJ files to link, you can remove the mentioned OBJ files from the current configuration of your project.</p>

		<h3 id="para_poptions">Particular options</h3>
			<p>In case you want to compile the application to be usable from a console, you need to exclude some files in the settings of the corresponding configuration:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>frame.cpp</li>
					<li>frame.h</li>
					<li>ec_plot.cpp</li>
					<li>ec_plot.h</li>
					<li>All the objects for STC</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Some files are systematically excluded from the build:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>roulette_*.cpp</li>
					<li>main_*.cpp</li>
					<li>random_*.cpp</li>
				</ul>
			<p>For the files &quot;main.cpp&quot; and &quot;roulette.cpp&quot;, disable the option &quot;Enable minimal rebuild&quot; in order that these files always get recompiled when the include files &quot;roulette_*.cpp&quot; are modified.</p>
			<p>For the generation of the translations, all the files *.H and *.CPP will be considered by PoEdit. If dedicated file extensions were used, the <a href="#sect_poedit">settings of PoEdit</a> would have been adjusted. The current files having *.INC as file extension don't contain relevant data for PoEdit.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_modes">GUI vs. Console</h2>
		<p>Scripted Roulette can be used in a console mode or with a user-interface. The detection is done automatically depending on the sub-system provided in the command-line at the time of the compilation.</p>
		<p>The GUI mode (also known as "graphical user interface") is more user-friendly while the console mode is light-weight. For the console, you have to make sure that &quot;_CONSOLE&quot; is defined.</p>

		<h3 id="para_noresponse">No response from the window in GUI mode</h3>
			<p>When you run a script which takes some time, the window may not respond and become fully white. This is caused by the design of the application.</p>
			<p>The execution of the script occurs in the same thread than the GUI interface. When a script is busy, there is no resource to refresh the main window.</p>
			<p>To solve this issue and to allow the user to click on the button &quot;Stop&quot;, we must process periodically the pending message queue. This is achieved with a safe yield (<a href="http://docs.wxwidgets.org/2.8/wx_wxapp.html#wxappyield" rel="nofollow">wxSafeYield</a>). However, the functions from the interface are disabled to avoid recursive calls.</p>
			<p>This yield is implicit via some instructions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&quot;<a href="#para_restart">RESTART</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#para_restart_sequence">RESTART SEQUENCE</a>&quot;.</li>
					<li>&quot;<a href="#inst_progress">PROGRESS</a>&quot; every 5%.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>If your script has a long loop and only one sequence, you can force the safe yield by calling &quot;<a href="#inst_restart">REFRESH</a>&quot;. In return, you have to control manually its call in order that you don't reduce the performances too much.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_build">Build</h2>
		<p>Once the above steps are performed, you can compile your project by using your usual IDE.</p>
		<p>If you want to, you can also reuse the suggested shell scripts for GCC and BCC. You will be first invited to check them in order to set up your directories if needed.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_poedit">Setup of PoEdit</h2>
		<p>If you use PoEdit to create or update some translations, you have nothing to change to its default configuration. It can be downloaded online from:</p>
			<ul><li><a href="http://poedit.net" rel="nofollow">http://poedit.net</a></li></ul>
		<p>If you simply want to contribute to the translation of Scripted Roulette without installing anything, you may just edit the file &quot;template.po&quot; with a text editor which supports the UTF8 encoding.</p>
		<p>The format of the PO file is presented at the following location:</p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext</a></li></ul>

	<h2 id="sect_localws">Setup of the local web server</h2>
		<p>Scripted Roulette includes an interface to retrieve <em>truly random</em> numbers from a web-service called Random.org. Since this service contains a quota per day and an initial offered volume, if you need to make some tests with the server without impacting the remaining quota, then you have to create an unsecured local web-service.</p>
		<p>The local script is written in PHP language. It means that you have to set up an HTTP server (Apache, nginx, lighttpd...) along with a PHP interpreter (PHP or HHVM). Please refer to the technical documentation of these products to achieve the configuration.</p>
		<p>For now, the scripts are available in the subfolder &quot;random_server&quot; that you have to make available at the following location:</p>
			<ul><li><a href="http://localhost/random_server/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/random_server/</a></li></ul>
		<p>If you read the GPL license in your browser, then the setup is complete provided that PHP scripts can be executed.</p>
		<p class="Center"><img src="localws.jpg" alt="" /></p>
		<p>If you need the scripts to be accessible from another location, you will have to edit the file named &quot;random.cpp&quot;. All the occurrences of <a href="http://localhost" rel="nofollow">http://localhost</a> will have to be changed. Please also note that the local HTTP service cannot be accessible if the application is compiled in release mode. This is due to the preprocessor directives.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_wget">Installing WGET</h2>
		<p>This dependency is needed if you want to get random numbers from the Internet, especially when the web-service requires a secured HTTPS connection.</p>
		<p>This solution is assumed to be better than Curl after some tests with wxGTK.</p>

		<h3 id="para_wgetl">Under Linux</h3>
			<p>You just need to install the package named &quot;WGET&quot;.</p>
			<p>You also need to get a support for SSL as it is the main expected feature.</p>

		<h3 id="para_wgetw">Under Windows</h3>
			<p>By chance, the nice tool WGET has been ported to Windows.</p>
			<p>To retrieve the main binary:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Open <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm</a></li>
					<li>Get the ZIP file in section &quot;Binaries&quot;.</li>
					<li>Extract &quot;wget.exe&quot; from the ZIP archive.</li>
					<li>Put this application in the same folder than the executable file for Scripted Roulette.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>To get support for SSL:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Open the same link.</li>
					<li>Get the ZIP file in section &quot;Dependencies&quot;.</li>
					<li>Extract all the DLL files from the ZIP archive.</li>
					<li>Put this library in the same folder than the executable file for Scripted Roulette.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>You should see something like that:</p>
			<p class="Center"><img src="wget.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p>You have to get these files on your own because they are released under the terms of the GPL v3 while Scripted Roulette is released in accordance with GPL v2. The packages cannot be merged and distributed together, but both are open-source and considered as separate works.</p>

<h1 id="chap_basics">Understand a script</h1>

	<h2 id="sect_formats">File formats</h2>
		<p>Two file extensions are supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>.SR – Main script</li>
				<li>.SRI – Includes that are not expected to be processed</li>
			</ul>
		<p>You cannot execute a script which is not linked to these extensions.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_struct">Structure of a script</h2>
		<p>Optionally, the script starts with a single block for the initialization. This section named &quot;.INIT&quot; doesn't accept all the commands. It is executed first and once when the script is launched. The main objective is to define the technical attributes of the roulette (layout, algorithm...), to initialize your variables and to display some information.</p>
		<p>Then the script is a succession of sequences. Each section is declared with the instruction &quot;.SEQUENCE&quot;. A sequence is independent in terms of execution of the instructions, but the variables are always global.</p>
		<p>Knowing that each instruction is detailed in the next sections, here is a simple <em>hello world</em>, namely a script writing something at the user's attention.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.INIT</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.number = <span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Hello world !'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You have defined this number:'</span> user.number</p>

		<h3 id="para_preproc">Preprocessor definitions</h3>
			<p>Starting from the version 0.2, it is possible to use the preprocessor directives. It is a non-executable information telling how the application should react in certain circumstances. The definition applies globally to the script.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of how to use the functionnality :</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Comment">"#version-min: 020"</span>
<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Hello world'</span></p>
			<p>The available directives are in the following table:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Directive</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>#version-min:(version)</td>
					<td>Introduction in the version 0.2.<br/><br/>The script won't be executed if the version of the application is not at least equal to the mentionned one. To get the version of the interpreter, you can click on the item "About" in the main menubar.<br/><br/>As the version is expected to have the format "a.b.c", the corresponding value will be "abc". For example, the version "0.2" (implicitely "0.2.0") returns the value 20. The variable "sys.version" contains the current value.<br/><br/>When the directive is not declared or when the provided value is incorrect, any version of the interpreter is allowed.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

	<h2 id="sect_comments">Commenting the script</h2>
		<p>When your script is becoming long, you need to write some comments. It also help to drive the visual aspect of the script.</p>
		<p>A comment is never executed. It is activated with a quote. Everything after it is removed.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SPIN</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"It spins the ball"</span></p>
		<p>The comments can also be used to highlight a group of instructions:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Comment">"New script"</span>
<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"== Let's spin"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SPIN</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You got:'</span> game.landed.number</p>
		<p>If you use the pretty script, you will see that the comments always end with a quote. This is not mandatory for Scripted Roulette. However, it is an important detail as shown in the next section.</p>
		<p>A quote used in the middle of a string has no effect:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'This quote &lt;"&gt; will remain.'</span></p>

	<h2 id="sect_control">Control of the syntax</h2>
		<p>The syntax is controlled on the fly during the execution of the script.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If an instruction is wrong, a warning or an error will be displayed in the log. When the error is judged sufficiently serious, the instruction is deleted and it can't be executed anymore. This can lead to some unexpected results if you don't take care of the generated messages.</li>
				<li>If you use complex conditions in your script, some lines may be not executed, then not checked.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Another way is to have a visual control of the syntax thanks to the rich editor <a href="#sect_scintilla">Scintilla</a>. It is available depending on the <a href="#sect_compile">options</a> you have set for the compilation of the application.</p>
		<p>If your code doesn't suit to the rules of the syntax highlighter, you can use the beautifier available in the GUI version of Scripted Roulette to perform the expected changes. Its aim is to indent the script, to put the right words in the right case, to save space and to align the comments. No control is done during the operation because each line is interpreted according to a recurrent pattern.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To see the effect of the beautifier and to realize the time it saves, you can load the corresponding demo file and call the feature. The code will be realigned, but both versions are executable.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2 id="sect_execution">Executing a script</h2>

		<h3 id="para_cmdline">Command line</h3>
			<p>If you drop a file on the application, the script is loaded. But some other commands are available:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Parameter</th>
					<th>Description</th>
					<th>Console</th>

						<ul><li>scripted_roulette.exe -l fr</li></ul>

		<h3 id="para_execgui">GUI</h3>
			<p>When you use the visual editor, you can run the script by clicking on the button entitled &quot;Execute&quot;. You are not forced to save your current script but it is safer if you use some instructions <a href="#sect_defloops">causing loops</a>.</p>
			<p>In case the program falls into an infinite loop or is long to terminate, you can use the button entitled &quot;Stop&quot; to end the script. This possibility is not offered all the time. Only some instructions will trigger an event allowing you to click on the button.</p>
				<ul><li>Example: this code cannot be stopped.</li></ul>

			<p>If you are not granted the right to stop at any moment, the explanation is mainly technical. Allowing it slows down the global performances. Moreover, the application is driven by only one thread.</p>

		<h3 id="para_debug">Debugger</h3>
			<p>A debugger is a tool which is able to execute a script step by step and to display the status of the memory in live. This feature has been introduced in the version 0.2 to solve the situation in which the script goes wrong.</p>
			<p>The debugger can be the embedded one or an external tool provided that the application is compiled in debug mode (the official release is not provided as such). Both debuggers are triggered by the unique instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_debug">DEBUG</a>&quot; or by setting a break-point in the margin. Not all the lines are breakable.</p>
			<p class="Center"><img src="debug_margin.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p>The embedded degugger is the following screen:</p>
			<p class="Center"><img class="NoBorder" src="debug.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p>The top area is a view of the lines of code being processed. The symbol "&gt;&gt;&gt;" is the current statement about to be interpreted. The displayed instructions belong to the same sequence. For few of them, some extra code can be generated and you will see it in this area. To extract the full generated code, you can call the instruction &quot;<a href="#para_show_script">SHOW SCRIPT</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>The text area serves to evaluate any mathematical expression. The variables of the list below on the left are reachable. It is not possible to execute an instruction on-the-fly. The result of the calculation is automatically updated when you reach the next instruction (immediate or not).</p>
			<p>The list on the left exposes all the available <a href="#sect_defvars">variables</a>. The list on the right shows all the modified values: the sign "-" means that the value has disappeared and the sign "+" means that the value has been defined. When a value is changed, you have the two signs and you are able to compare.</p>
			<p>To modify a variable belonging to a domain name writable by the users, double-click on the right one in the list on the left. The displayed input field accepts a numerical value or a mathematical expression. An error is displayed if the result is wrong. You can't delete any variable.</p>
			<p>The buttons at the bottom manage the interface:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Continue : the script is executed until another break-point is found.</li>
					<li>Step : you jump to the next instruction whatever the existihg break-points.</li>
					<li>Validate  : if you consider that the issue is solved, the debugger will be skipped until the script ends.</li>
					<li>Stop : the execution of the script is immediately stopped as if you called the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_stop">STOP</a>&quot;</li>
				</ul>

	<h2 id="sect_randomness">Randomness</h2>

		<h3 id="para_algorithms">Algorithms</h3>
			<p>Most of the pseudorandom number generators (&quot;PRNG&quot;) implemented in Scripted Roulette are mathematical series known for being not safe for cryptographic uses. In other words, they are basic, like the linear congruential generators. There is no external factor influencing the algorithm with quite-unpredictable random values.</p>
			<p>Without external factors (like time, events, gestures...), it is not possible to generate a <em>true</em> random number. However, it is possible to implement some rules to have an acceptable randomness between 0 and 38.</p>
			<p>Precisely, each series of numbers is composed of an initial value (also known as X<sub>0</sub>) and the next value is calculated from the previous values. It can be written: X<sub>n+1</sub>=f(X<sub>n</sub>) where f() is the secret algorithm which gives you an impression of randomness. In the case of the linear congruential generators, X<sub>n+1</sub>=(a*X<sub>n</sub>+b) modulo c where a, b and c are constants to be precisely chosen.</p>
			<p>There is no definition of a &quot;good algorithm&quot; except that it is not easily predictable. In Scripted Roulette, you will find classical algorithms with a normal distribution (or not), a high volatility (or not), a high periodicity (or not), etc...</p>
			<p>If you want to analyze the distribution of an algorithm, you can call the instruction &quot;<a href="#para_show_distribution">SHOW DISTRIBUTION</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>The supported algorithms (ordered by the lowest deviation shown in a parenthesis) are described below. The proposed deviation is obtained after 500000 spins for each number of the roulette. After multiple manual runs, it is the smallest fetched value and it may vary on your own computer.</p>
			<p>To get a better understanding of the PRNG, some embedded features of Scripted Roulette can <a href="#sect_compile">be enabled</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><ins>Distribution</ins>: it spins N numbers on a square, and puts all the target pixels in white whatever the frequency. It helps to determine if there are &quot;zones&quot;.</li>
					<li><ins>Hot map</ins>: it spins millions of times on a square, and the light of the target pixels is increased progressively. It helps to determine if a point is hit regularly or not.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>We deduct some easy rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When the hot map is the same than the distribution, it means that black areas are never a possible result.</li>
					<li>When the hot map is of variable gray levels, it means that the algorithm is able to target the numbers with a quite good distribution.</li>
					<li>When the hot map is mostly black with few white dots, the algorithm has limited capabilities.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3 id="para_algo_equi">Equal distribution - EQUI (3)</h3>
			<p>This generator is made for Scripted Roulette. It generates every number with an equal distribution after some time (very low deviation).</p>
			<p>The function is based on exclusive-OR operations with shifted bits. However, the precise mathematical background is unknown.</p>
			<p><ins>Restriction</ins>: the algorithm only applies to the French roulette (37 numbers). When using other roulettes, the distribution is no more regular at all.</p>

		<h3 id="para_algo_clock">Computer clock - CLOCK (482)</h3>
			<p>This generator is made for Scripted Roulette. It is based on the internal timer of your processor (CPU) and uses no initial seed. Each time you do something with your computer, the counter of the processor is updated. Then the value is recomputed to provoke an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow" rel="nofollow">integer overflow</a> which leads to another value of the same size.</p>
			<p><ins>Restriction</ins>: the state of this algorithm cannot be restored to its initial value. You will always get a different value each time you call this generator. This non-reproducibility makes the algorithm harder to predict.</p>

			<p>To prevent the exhaustion of your quota and the overload of the server, it is not possible to make a statistical analysis of this online server by using some specials functions like &quot;<a href="#para_show_distribution">SHOW DISTRIBUTION</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="#para_save_hotmap">SAVE HOTMAP</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>According to the service, you are granted of quota of 1 million bits, refilled by 200000 every day (or more if the service is able to support it). The control is done based on your IP address.

	<h2 id="sect_defvars">Define a variable</h2>
		<p>A variable is an object having a name and which is able to store an integer or a floating-point number. Technically, a value is always saved as a floating-point number because it is the most generic case. When you call it as an integer, the value is truncated (not rounded to the nearest value).</p>
		<p>A variable is always named according to a naming convention: &quot;domain.name&quot;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The domain groups the variables and controls the updates.</li>
				<li>The name is a name that can be given freely to identify some data.</li>
				<li>It is possible to have sub-names (like &quot;user.loop.key1&quot;).</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The variables can be defined by the user for the requirements of the script, but they can also be generated by some instructions, especially the one which spins the ball or makes statistics.</p>

		<h3 id="para_sysvars">System variables</h3>
			<p>A system variable has to be understood at the level of the application, not of the operating system (Windows, Linux...).</p>
			<p>A system variable typically defines immutable values or connects to the special settings of the roulette. For that reason, their creation, modification and deletion is strictly controlled. The domain is equal to &quot;sys&quot;.</p>
			<p>The easily accessible variables are the following:</p>

			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

						<br/>
						<br/>The variable is mostly used to condition the call to the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_debug">DEBUG</a>&quot; which is restricted to the developers. In release mode, the instruction generates a warning that you can <a href="#sect_hidew">turn off</a>.
					</td>
				</tr>

		<h3 id="para_statvars">Statistics</h3>

	<h2 id="sect_defarrays">Define an array</h2>
		<p>This new feature is available since the version 0.2.</p>

		<h3 id="para_arrsyntax">Syntax</h3>
			<p>An array is a mono- or multi-dimensional group of variables assigned to the same technical name. By using a numerical identifier, you have access to the individual values. The syntax is:</p>
			<p class="Code">user.arrayname[dimension1]([dimension2](...))</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"user" is the domain of the variable. You can only use this one safely.</li>
					<li>"arrayname" is the free name that you can give to identify your array.</li>
					<li>"dimension" is a signed numerical index described the position of a value within the array. If you repeat the dimension, you increase the depth of the array.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>If you want to define the decimals of PI, the array has only 1 dimension:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi[<span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi[<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi[<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi[<span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi[<span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">9</span></p>
			<p>If you want to define the identity matrix 2x2, the array will have 2 dimensions:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span></p>
			<p>With the two examples above, there is no convention for the indexes. Let's suppose that N is the size of the array. Traditionally, the users will choose to start from 1 and end with N because it is natural for them. But the software developers prefer to work with an interval starting from 0 and ending with N-1 because it is how the memory is always managed. For Scripted Roulette, there is no particular rule: it depends on how you want to write your scripts.</p>

		<h3 id="para_arrsubnames">Internal naming</h3>
			<p>To be able to store an array, a flat name is used. The index is part of the underlying name of the variable. The following example is two ways of doing the same thing:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array_1 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span></p>
			<p>With multi-dimensional arrays, you have the same effect:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array_1_2 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span></p>
			<p class="Important"><strong>Warning:</strong> as the square brackets are replaced by an underscore to support the arrays, if you want to have 2 normal variables with the same name, please name the second one like "user.var2" instead of "user.var_2".</p>
			<p>When the evaluation of a square bracket fails, the resulting name contains the underscore but no number after it. In such case, you get a warning message in the log.</p>

		<h3 id="para_arrnegid">Negative indexes</h3>
			<p>The direct consequence of implicitly using flat names is that you can, as a very special feature, use negative indexes !</p>
			<p>The minus sign is replaced by a zero. So the following example is two ways of doing the same thing:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[-<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array_01_0 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span></p>
			<p>On contrary to the underscore, the zero is convenient and doesn't contradict the dimensions of the array. Look at this example:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">01</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[-<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">20</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">01</span>] <span class="SR_String">'vs.'</span> user.array[-<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>]
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ASSERT</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_arrcombo">Combinations</h3>
			<p>An array is handled as a variable. Therefore, you can combine it in complex statements.</p>
			<p>The following example is correct: it will bet on the number 22.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.tab[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">30</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.tab[-<span class="SR_Numeric">29</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">22</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> user.tab[-(user.tab[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>]-<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>)]
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SHOW</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">TABLE</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_arralloc">Allocate an array</h3>
			<p>If you try to access an uninitialized value of the array, you will get into trouble.</p>
			<p>To ensure that it will not happen, you can write your script carefully or try to set by default to zero all the values of the single or multi-dimensional array with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_allocate">ALLOCATE</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>It is assumed that having large arrays is not recommended.</p>

		<h3 id="para_arrunset">Unset an array</h3>
			<p>It is not mandatory to initialize all the values of an array. You may keep it empty (in fact, you never set its size) or jump an index during the initialization. In compensation, you must not access to a non-initialized position.</p>
			<p>To remove a single value from an array, write:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>]
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>]</p>
			<p>To unset a mono-dimensional array completely, you can use one of the two following syntaxes. It will apply as well for the multi-dimensional arrays because of the <a href="#para_arrsubnames">naming convention</a>.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.array[]
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.array*</p>
			<p>With multi-dimensional arrays, you can remove one dimension at the same time without changing the other ones:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"Define the values"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>

    <span class="SR_Comment">"Unset the dimension of your choice"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.matrix[][<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>]
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.matrix[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][]</p>
			<p>To be effective, you have to specify all the dimensions of your array.</p>

		<h3 id="para_arrcoexist">Coexistence of the dimensions</h3>
			<p>The full implicit name of the array is given by its dimensions. Therefore, it is possible to have several arrays of the same name at the condition that they have different dimensionalities.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>][<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span></p>
			<p>This way of coding is <strong>not</strong> recommended because it collides with the deletion of the arrays. With the previous example, to unset the mono-dimensional array, you can write "UNSET user.var[]" but it will remove the multi-dimensional array as well, which is probably not expected.</p>
			<p>The workaround is to unset the array explicitely, position by position. It will result in a higher quantity of lines in the script and the performances will be lower.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_defconds">Define a condition</h2>
		<p>In conditions, we use the Boolean logic. As there is no Boolean format, only numbers are used: &quot;sys.true&quot; is equal to 1, and &quot;sys.false&quot; is equal to 0.</p>

		<h3 id="para_syntax">Syntax</h3>
			<p>A condition is given by the instructions IF...ELSE...ENDIF written on dedicated lines.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (statement)
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'True case'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'False case'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<p>If the statement is true, the first block is processed. Else, the second block is processed.</p>
			<p>The block &quot;ELSE&quot; is optional:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (statement)
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'True case'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<p>The conditions can be imbricated like Russian dolls. In such an example, we understand why indenting the script is important for its understanding.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (statement 1)
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The first condition is true'</span>

		<h3 id="para_boolnot">Apply NOT on a Boolean variable</h3>

        <span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> loop_one
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>

		<p>If you need to restart a loop inside the loop, you can directly change the value of the counter. But beware of the infinite loops which are not monitored. If you fall into this situation, Scripted Roulette will never stop, so you will have to kill the process with the process monitor of your operating system.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_hidew">Hide the generated warnings</h2>
		<p>For some commands, the application is able to generate warnings.</p>
		<p>To ignore them, you have to add &quot;@&quot; before the instruction.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.INIT</span>
     <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> sys.type balanced mexican
    @<span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> sys.type balanced mexican</p>
		<p>Some messages cannot be avoided, like most of the encountered errors.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_maths">Use mathematical expressions</h2>
		<p>Scripted Roulette includes a parser of mathematical expressions. All the classical operations are supported.</p>
		<p>At any moment a variable needs to be converted into a number or when you need to calculate, the mathematical engine is called. You then have to respect the standard mathematical rules: priorities, signs...</p>
		<p>The sole thing that you can't do to implying a <a href="#para_boolnot">logical operator</a> or a complex number in an expression.</p>

		<h3 id="para_funclist">List of the functions</h3>
			<p>The extended list of the supported functions can be found online:</p>
				<ul><li><a href="http://wxecmath.sourceforge.net/funclist.html">http://wxecmath.sourceforge.net/funclist.html</a></li></ul>
			<p>The little thing to know is the naming convention of the logarithm. Indeed <em>log</em> is in base 10 while <em>ln</em> is in base <em>e</em>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>log(exp(1)) is <ins>not</ins> equal to 1</li>
					<li>ln(exp(1)) = 1</li>
				</ul>
			<p>You cannot use complex numbers.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_numfmt">Format the numbers</h2>

		<h3 id="para_fmtfloat">As a floating-point number</h3>
			<p>As <a href="#sect_defvars">written previously</a>, all the numbers are stored as floating-point values. However, you will mostly use them as integers.</p>
			<p>The translation is always implicit. With the instructions dedicated to display some text (&quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="#inst_status">STATUS</a>&quot;...), you have to force the value if you need the decimals by using the key &quot;f:&quot;.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.value = <span class="SR_Numeric">8.5</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Integer:'</span> user.value
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Float:'</span> f:user.value</p>
			<p>You can refer to the sample &quot;function_decimals.sr&quot; for another example.</p>
			<p>The use of this flag is required when you make some final statistics: display of percentages, etc...</p>

		<h3 id="para_fmtchar">As a character</h3>
			<p>Scripted Roulette doesn't really handle the characters because the principal objective is to manipulate the numbers.</p>
			<p>Each character (like 'a', 'b', '.', '-'...) is represented with an internal numerical identifier. Historically, it is named the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" rel="nofollow">ASCII table</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>To print the character associated to a number, you have to use the prefix "c:" as follows:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The 50th character is'</span> c:<span class="SR_Numeric">50</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The 100th character is'</span> c:<span class="SR_Numeric">100</span></p>
			<p>Some character codes are not printable. Therefore, you will see a rectangle in the output text.</p>

	<h2 id="sect_defstring">Define a string</h2>
		<p>A string is a collection of characters put together to make a sentence readable by a human being.</p>
		<p>As each character is assigned to a fixed number, any string can be converted into an <a href="#sect_defarrays">array</a> of numbers.</p>
		<p>Starting from the version 0.2, Scripted Roulette is equiped with few string-related functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#inst_input">INPUT</a> : with the modifier "string", the input text is converted into an array of numbers.</li>
				<li><a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a> : with the modifier &quot;<a href="#sect_numfmt">c:</a>&quot;, any numerical code can be represented by its corresponding character.
					<ul>
						<li>Remark: if the font of the output doesn't support the character, it will be display like a blank rectangle.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<p>By essence, you can consider that handling strings is not the purpose of Scripted Roulette. Indeed, when you play the roulette, you don't concatenate characters. The strings must be seen as a way of obtaining complex bits for mathematical purposes.</p>
		<p>To see the strings in action, you can refer to the sample named "Base64".</p>


<h1 id="chap_index">Index of the available instructions</h1>

	<h2 id="inst_allocate">ALLOCATE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>2 or more composite arguments.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The instruction initializes to zero (not changeable) all the values of an array.</p>
		<p>The first argument is the name of the target variable to be defined as an array. The domain of the variable must be "user".</p>
		<p>The next arguments are separated with a space. They define the size of the array for each dimension. The range is from 1 to N. Each argument can be a formula provided that there is no space in it. The allocation fails if the formula returns a wrong value (negative, zero, error during the calculation...).</p>
		<p>The following example initializes several arrays having different dimensions :</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ALLOCATE</span> user.onedimensions <span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ALLOCATE</span> user.twodimensions <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>*<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ALLOCATE</span> user.threedimensions <span class="SR_Numeric">4</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span></p>
		<p>Reallocating the array over the same technical name doesn't remove the previous values. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow <a href="#para_arrunset">the procedure</a> with the help of the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_unset">UNSET</a>&quot; called before.</p>
		<p>To prevent the memory from being abused, you will get an error if you try to allocate an array greater than 16384 values. For multi-dimensional arrays, the size is the product of the size of each dimension. To bypass this limitation (at your own risk), you have to use an '@' in front of the instruction.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    @<span class="SR_Keyword">ALLOCATE</span> user.too_much <span class="SR_Numeric">50</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">50</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">50</span></p>
		<p>At the end of the execution of the script, the user interface (in <a href="#sect_modes">GUI mode</a>) will try to display all the variables known by the script. If you have used a large array, this operation can be slow and the interface may not respond. To avoid that, at the end of the script, you can delete the array or all the variables.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    @<span class="SR_Keyword">ALLOCATE</span> user.too_much <span class="SR_Numeric">50</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">50</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">50</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"...Do something..."</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> all</p>

	<h2 id="inst_append">APPEND</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot; is used to generate a message in the log. If you want to complete it without adding a new line in the log, you can use this new instruction.</p>
		<p>The added text will be concatenated to the last message with no space in between. If it doesn't exist, the message is created.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_assert">ASSERT</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>An assertion is a logical expression which is expected to be always true. The arguments are evaluated and if the result is false, then the execution of the script is stopped (see the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_stop">STOP</a>&quot;).</p>
		<p>The logical expression must be written in conformance with the recommendations of the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_if">IF</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>This instruction is in fact a macro which implicitly generates the following code:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (statement)
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">NOT</span> sys.last_if
        <span class="SR_Keyword">STOP</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>Consequently, you can't rely on the value of &quot;sys.last_if&quot; after a call to the instruction &quot;ASSERT&quot;.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_backup">BACKUP</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction allows you save all the current variables of the simulation in a temporary memory space. The affected variables can be listed with the instruction &quot;<a href="#para_show_memory">SHOW MEMORY</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>To restore the variables to their initial state, you have to call the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_rollback">ROLLBACK</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>To remove the backup, you can call the instruction &quot;<a href="#para_clear_backup">CLEAR BACKUP</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>You are not supposed to use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_spin">SPIN</a>&quot; between the moments when you save and restore the variables because the log is not saved and it won't be restored. Else unexpected discrepancy may arise.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_beep">BEEP</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console, but not for a Linux console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction activates the loudspeaker of your computer or produces a sound as defined by your operating system.</p>
		<p>Its use is recommended to warn the user for an event occurring after a long time the script is running.</p>
		<p>It is recommended that you don't call this instruction too often because the sound is generally not synchronous.</p>
		<p>The instructions generating popup windows typically generate built-in beeps along with the displayed message. Thus, if the time is too short between the last call to &quot;BEEP&quot; and the display of the popup window, you will hear no difference.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_bet">BET</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1. Enhanced in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument or more.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="para_bet_desc">Description</h3>
			<p>This instruction is one of the most important because it validates your bets for the roulette. Its behavior is influenced by the following variables:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The amount of the bet is given by the variable &quot;game.bet&quot;. But if the target pays 1 to 2, then the bet will be doubled to avoid partial counters.</li>
					<li>The ability to bet is given by &quot;sys.can_bet&quot;. Unless you use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_cbet">CBET</a>&quot;, the bet is by default unlimited and will open a credit line if you have insufficient funds. As a restriction, this variable applies for 1 amount of the bet. Then if you are betting 2 numbers at a time, it doesn't guarantee that a credit line will not be contracted.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>After it is played, the instruction updates some statistics (refer to the <a href="#sect_defvars">corresponding section</a>), especially &quot;sys.game.stake&quot; which represents the money you will pay out to play the current round.</p>
			<p>It is possible to bet on one number, multiple numbers or groups of numbers at a time. Starting from the version 0.2, it is possible to use dynamic bets for the non-straight numbers.</p>

		<h3 id="para_bet_straight">Straight number</h3>
			<p>Betting on 1 number allows the highest return as it pays 35 to 1.</p>
			<p>The number can be named directly, stored in a variable or calculated. If you calculate, don't use any space in the formula else it will be considered as separate bets.</p>

		<h3 id="para_bet_parity">Even &amp; Odd</h3>
			<p>To bet on even numbers (2, 4, 6...), you can call this instruction:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> even</p>
			<p>To bet on odd numbers (1, 3, 5...), you can call this instruction:</p>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> odd</p>
			<p>The zeros are neither even, nor odd. When you use the functions EVEN() or ODD() as part of a <a href="#sect_maths">mathematical expression</a>, the zeros may return unexpected results. Indeed &quot;00&quot; and &quot;000&quot; have their internal numerical identifier.</p>

		<h3 id="para_bet_dyn">Dynamic bets for non-straight numbers</h3>
			<p>To understand this feature introduced with the version 0.2, let's consider a simple case.</p>
			<p>If you want to bet randomly on 3 numbers (&quot;<a href="#para_bet_street">street</a>&quot;), you can use the following sample:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">11</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"Returning from 0 to 11"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">6</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"...etc..."</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">11</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">34</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">36</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<p>The syntax can be very long and subject to mistakes. So the new feature consists in having two different expressions designing the same bet. The character used to separate them is the vertical bar "|". The example above is equivalent to this one:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">11</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"Returning from 0 to 11"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>*sys.random+<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>|<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>*(sys.random+<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>)</p>
			<p>It is important that the expressions contain no space, else they will be considered as separate bets. An error will generally be generated if you don't respect that rule.</p>
			<p>To increase the complexity of the demo, if you want to bet randomly on 4 numbers (&quot;<a href="#para_bet_corner">corner</a>&quot;), you can use the following sample:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">21</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"Returning from 0 to 21"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">6</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">8</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"...etc..."</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.random = <span class="SR_Numeric">21</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">32</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">36</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<p>However, it is easier to adopt the new syntax where each corner is vertically assigned to an identifier.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"Returning from 0 to 10"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.choice = <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>*sys.random+<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> even(sys.random)
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> user.choice|user.choice+<span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> user.choice+<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>|user.choice+<span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<p>Finally, when you have to choose between two values, you can do differently <a href="#para_bet_half">with a function</a> for example.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_bits">BITS</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>2 composite arguments.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction converts an integer into an <a href="#sect_defarrays">array</a> of bits.</p>
		<p>The first argument is the name of the target variable to be defined as an array. The domain of the variable must be "user".</p>
		<p>The second argument (and following ones) is an expression to evaluate as a whole and whose result is converted into a positive (then unsigned) integer.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BITS</span> user.bits <span class="SR_Numeric">52</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SHOW</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">MEMORY</span></p>
		<p>You will get the following array:</p>
		<p class="Code">user.bits_0 = 0,000000
user.bits_1 = 0,000000
user.bits_2 = 1,000000
user.bits_3 = 0,000000
user.bits_4 = 1,000000
user.bits_5 = 1,000000</p>
		<p>Each position of the array corresponds to a power of 2 as per the design of the computers. The position 0 is the least significant bit and the highest position (which depends on the size of the converted integer) is the most significant bit. Consequently, the first index of the array is 0.</p>
		<p>To find the size of the array when the instruction is called, you can iterate with the help of the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_exist">EXIST</a>&quot;. Else you can use the following mathematical relation which can be simplified if you know the parity of the converted number.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.number = <span class="SR_Numeric">52</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> user.number = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.max_index = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> user.number &gt; <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
            <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.max_index = ceil(log(int(user.number))/log(<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>)) - <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
            <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.max_index = ceil(log(int(-user.number))/log(<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>)) - <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>With the example above: 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 4 + 16 + 32 = 52.</p>
		<p>When you call this instruction, the target variable is implicitly deleted with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_unset">UNSET</a>&quot;, making useless any call to the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_allocate">ALLOCATE</a>&quot;. You have to make sure that you respect the constraints of the <a href="#para_arrunset">deletion of the arrays</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_break">BREAK</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A script is a succession of sequences. When the instruction &quot;BREAK&quot; is called, the execution of the current sequence is stopped and the next sequence is launched. If the current sequence is the last sequence of the script, the execution of the script is stopped.</p>
		<p>On contrary to other programming languages, the instruction doesn't exit a loop if it is comprised between &quot;<a href="#inst_label">LABEL</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#inst_goto">GOTO</a>&quot;. To exit such a loop, you have to use conditional statements or a special instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_goto">GOTO</a>&quot; targeting a &quot;<a href="#inst_label">LABEL</a>&quot; out of the loop.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_buy">BUY</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>When you run out of money, you have to refill your stock of counters. Therefore, you go to the cashier to buy new ones. The bought amount will first reimburse the credit and then will increase your current cash.</p>
		<p>In fact, you can bet unlimitedly but you have to take care of your credit line that will have to be reimbursed at the end. The net result is given by the variable &quot;game.net&quot;.</p>
		<p>The following examples are equivalent:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BUY</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.amount = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BUY</span> user.amount</p>

	<h2 id="inst_cbet">CBET</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument or more.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>&quot;CBET&quot; means &quot;conditional bet&quot;. It is a macro which will check for you if you have sufficient cash and in the limit given by the maximal bet of the casino. It generates implicitly the following code:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.game.can_bet
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> (arguments)
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>The check is based on the variable &quot;sys.game.can_bet&quot; for which <a href="#para_sysvars">a limitation applies</a>. Except if you are sure, instruction &quot;CBET&quot; is recommended to be used with one bet at a time.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">CBET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">12</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"It is not recommended"</span>

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">CBET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">CBET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">12</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_confirm">CONFIRM</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI mode only. Equivalent to &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot; in console mode.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction displays a text in a popup window. The user has then the possibility to reply Yes, No or Cancel.</p>
		<p>This instruction has the same technical behavior than the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_popup">POPUP</a>&quot;. The difference is in the processing of the return code. By checking the value of the variable &quot;sys.popup&quot;, you can know which button was pressed.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">CONFIRM</span> <span class="SR_String">'Do you want to continue ?'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.popup = sys.popup.yes
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You pressed YES'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.popup = sys.popup.no
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You pressed NO'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.popup = sys.popup.cancel
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You pressed CANCEL'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p><ins>Restriction</ins>: you should never use directly the integer values stored behind &quot;sys.popup.yes&quot;, &quot;sys.popup.no&quot; or &quot;sys.popup.cancel&quot;. They are dependent on the operating system.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_check">CHECK</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A check is a logical expression which is expected to be always true. It is different from the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_assert">ASSERT</a>&quot; because when the condition is false, you simply exit the current sequence (not the script globally). This is the effect of the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_break">BREAK</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>The logical expression must be written in conformance with the recommendations of instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_if">IF</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>This instruction is in fact a macro which implicitly generates the following code:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (statement)
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">NOT</span> sys.last_if
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BREAK</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_clear">CLEAR</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction allows deleting data not related to the classical variables set by the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_set">SET</a>&quot;. Because it is not direct to access some settings of the roulette, special instructions have been reserved.</p>
		<p>The syntax is simple. The instruction &quot;CLEAR&quot; is followed by a composite argument among the following list.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_backup">CLEAR BACKUP</h3>
			<p>This instruction has been introduced from the version 0.2.</p>
			<p>It resets the backup that you have created with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_backup">BACKUP</a>&quot;. The effect is like as if you never called the latter.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_bets">CLEAR BETS</h3>
			<p>When you bet on 1 or several numbers with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_bet">BET</a>&quot;, you have no way to undo that bet without removing all the bets from the table.</p>
			<p>The instruction &quot;CLEAR BETS&quot; is very effective to reset the table and the engaged money.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_console">CLEAR CONSOLE</h3>
			<p>The instruction clears the messages generated by the scripted roulette.</p>
			<p>This has the consequence to flush the screen if you are using the application in a console, and to clear the log from the view in GUI mode. </p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_history">CLEAR HISTORY</h3>
			<p>Each time you spin a number, it is saved in a table along with the current parameters of the bet.</p>
			<p>This instruction clears the history. The operation cannot be undone but you can save it before (refer to the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_save">SAVE</a>&quot;).</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_landed_number">CLEAR LANDED NUMBER</h3>
			<p>Each time you spin the ball, the corresponding instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_spin">SPIN</a>&quot; updates some variables. They are named inside the domain &quot;game.landed&quot;.</p>
			<p>When you call &quot;CLEAR LANDED NUMBER&quot;, you remove all the data related to the last spin. Therefore you have no more practical information about the last number you got.</p>
			<p>The instruction only removes the statistics, but it doesn't undo the spin. A trace will still be present in the historical log.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_last_history">CLEAR LAST HISTORY</h3>
			<p>This instruction removes the last entry of the history of the spins created by the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_spin">SPIN</a>&quot;.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_log">CLEAR LOG</h3>
			<p>This instruction has the same effect than the instruction &quot;<a href="#para_clear_console">CLEAR CONSOLE</a>&quot;.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_money">CLEAR MONEY</h3>
			<p>This instruction should not be interpreted as a way to drop your money, but rather as a cleansing operation to delete the evolution of your money.</p>
			<p>In GUI mode, you have access to a graph showing your current cash (blue line) and credit (red line). After the call to this instruction, the curves are reset.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_random">CLEAR RANDOM</h3>
			<p>First, review the <a href="#sect_randomness">basic concepts</a> of the implemented pseudorandom number generators.</p>
			<p>When you call &quot;CLEAR RANDOM&quot;, you restore the generators to their initial state. Then you can get the same spins again for a new sequence.</p>
			<p>This feature is convenient to compare the effects of various sequences on the same dataset.</p>
			<p>To make this instruction working at its best, you have to call &quot;<a href="#inst_randomize">RANDOMIZE</a>&quot; in the section &quot;.INIT&quot;. You can refer to a demo file to get a practical example.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_stat">CLEAR STAT</h3>
			<p>With the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_stat">STAT</a>&quot;, it is possible to get some statistical information about all the landed numbers. Concretely, it creates variables inside the domain &quot;stat&quot;.</p>
			<p>To remove these variables, the instruction &quot;CLEAR STAT&quot; can be used.</p>

		<h3 id="para_clear_time">CLEAR TIME</h3>
			<p>This instruction has been introduced from the version 0.2.</p>
			<p>It resets the time stamp that you have saved with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_time">TIME</a>&quot;. The effect is like as if you never called the latter.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_debug">DEBUG</h2>
		<p>With the development of the debugger in the version 0.2, this instruction has been refactored. It exists in two versions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"DEBUG" to call the internal debugger (GUI only).</li>
				<li>"DEBUG EXTERNAL" to call the external debugger (GUI and console).</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The debugger is a screen which interrupts the execution of the script for the purpose of analysing its behaviour. A dedicated section explains <a href="#para_debug">how the debugger works</a>.</p>
		<p>If you use the sign "@" before the instruction, the break is done on the next instruction. It makes it more discrete.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    @<span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BEEP</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_debug_onoff">DEBUG ON/OFF</h3>
			<p>You can prevent the debugger from being called for a time. For that, you have to write the following instruction. This operation is equivalent to clicking on the <a href="#para_debug">button "Validate"</a> in the debugger.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">OFF</span></p>
			<p>The reverse operation which reactivates the debugger is trivial:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">ON</span></p>
			<p>These instructions are convenient if you want to debug the scripts having long processing times. Indeed, you define once a condition and every instruction "DEBUG" will inherit from the activation status. From the screen of the debugger, the user has an additionnal control of the execution of the script.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (a given condition)
        <span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">ON</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">OFF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>

    <span class="SR_Comment">"... Do something here ..."</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"It will be triggered conditionally even if there is no immediate surrounding condition"</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"... Do something here ..."</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_debug_external">DEBUG EXTERNAL</h3>
			<p>Scripted Roulette is a compiled application written in C++ and Assembly language. The sources can be downloaded from the official website. For the purposes of its further development, it may be necessary to crash the application in certain conditions with a trap in order that it gets rescued by a <em>debugger</em>. Such a tool used by the software developers can analyze the memory of the computer and the execution of the program in parallel of the source code. It helps to understand why the execution of a script is not working well or how it can run better.</p>
			<p>For the end users, this instruction is strictly useless. Moreover, if you try to call the function in the public version of the application, you will get an error telling that the instruction is not enabled, unless you write:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.debug
        <span class="SR_Keyword">DEBUG EXTERNAL</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<p>This instruction considers the status of the debugger set with the instruction "DEBUG ON/OFF".</p>

	<h2 id="inst_dec">DEC</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction stands for &quot;decrement&quot;. In other words, it subtracts 1 from the variable given as unique parameter.</p>
		<p>This instruction is popular to manage <a href="#sect_defloops">loops</a>.</p>
		<p>This instruction is in fact a macro which implicitly generates the following code:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> (variable) = (variable) - <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_exist">EXIST</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 or several arguments.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction verifies that all the variables of the argument list exist.</p>
		<p>The result is returned in the variable named &quot;sys.return&quot; which takes &quot;sys.true&quot; or &quot;sys.false&quot; as a possible value.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">EXIST</span> game.cash game.credit user.flag
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.result

    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'At least one of the variables doesn'</span><span class="SR_String">'t exist.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_goto">GOTO</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="para_goto_mechanism">Mechanism</h3>
			<p>This instruction performs a jump to another instruction. Precisely it targets an instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_label">LABEL</a>&quot; which handles a name. This name to reach is specified after the instruction.</p>
			<p>In the following example, an instruction is never executed because the jump in not conditional:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> jump
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'This text will not be shown.'</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> jump
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'However, this text will be displayed.'</span></p>
			<p>To jump conditionally, you can use conditions. The previous code can be rewritten as follows, and no instruction &quot;GOTO&quot; is used.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.false
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'This text will not be shown.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'However, this text will be displayed.'</span></p>
			<p>If you use the instruction &quot;GOTO&quot; with no condition, you face the risk of falling into an infinite loop. To stop this situation, you have to kill the application with the task manager.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> infinite
    <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something until the end of your infinite life"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> infinite</p>
			<p>By using a conditional statement, you are able to execute several times a set of instructions and to pilot its end. This is called &quot;managing loops&quot;. In many algorithms, you will be forced to master the use of loops. This is a simple example issued from the demo files:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.loop <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> loop
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> user.loop <span class="SR_String">'...'</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">DEC</span> user.loop
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> user.loop &gt; <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
        @<span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> loop
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'... Ignition!! ...'</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_goto_jumps">Cross jumps</h3>
			<p>You are not allowed to jump to another section of the main script. The following code will fail:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> next_sequence

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> next_sequence
    <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something..."</span></p>
			<p>If you have to exit a sequence, you simply have to call instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_break">BREAK</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>If you have to jump to the end of the script, you simply have to call instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_stop">STOP</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>If you have to jump deeper in the next sequence, you have to use a global flag stored in a variable and write something like the following:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.INIT</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.far_jump = <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"Write your condition"</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.far_jump = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">BREAK</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>

    <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something"</span>

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> user.far_jump = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> next
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>

    <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something if user.far_jump is not equal to 1"</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> next
    <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something"</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_goto_deep">Deeper targets</h3>
			<p>You are able to jump at any location of the script. However the context is not checked. Especially, if you jump at a level which is not expected you can assign wrong data.</p>
			<p>In the following example, without the unconditional instruction &quot;GOTO&quot;, the target result would have been 2 but is equal to 5 finally.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    @<span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> deeper
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.false
        <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> deeper

    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.number <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You picked:'</span> user.number</p>

	<h2 id="inst_if">IF, ELSE and ENDIF</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The definition of conditions has been detailed in a <a href="#sect_defconds">previous section</a>. You will not be able to write a scripted roulette without conditions.</p>
		<p>The syntax is easy:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> [statement]
        <span class="SR_Comment">"Instructions if the statement is true"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Comment">"Instructions if the statement is false"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>A statement is a combination of expressions separated by a logical operator. You simply have to be very careful about the way the <a href="#para_priorities">priorities</a> are <ins>not</ins> managed.</p>
		<p>The block &quot;ELSE&quot; is not mandatory:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> [statement]
        <span class="SR_Comment">"Instructions if the statement is true"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>The instruction &quot;ELIF&quot;, a merge of an &quot;ELSE&quot; and an &quot;IF&quot;, is not supported. In case you have to combine conditions, you just have to follow this example:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> (statement1)
        <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something here if statement_1 is true"</span>

    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_inc">INC</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
			<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
			<li>1 argument.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This instruction stands for &quot;increment&quot;. In other words, it adds 1 to the variable given as unique parameter.</p>
		<p>This instruction is popular to manage <a href="#sect_defloops">loops</a>.</p>
		<p>This instruction is in fact a macro which implicitly generates the following code:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> (variable) = (variable) + <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_include">INCLUDE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction is a macro used during the preprocessing of the current script to include the content of an external file. If you share some common lines of codes between several scripted roulettes, using the include files will reduce the global workload of maintenance. The demos of Scripted Roulette heavily rely on this technique.</p>
		<p>An include file has a <a href="#sect_formats">dedicated file extension</a> and cannot be executed directly. The argument of the instruction is the name of the include file without the extension. You don't use the apostrophes to delimit the string.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.INIT</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">INCLUDE</span> external_file <span class="SR_Comment">"The file is 'external_file.sri' and its content will be pasted here"</span></p>
		<p>You can put &quot;INCLUDE&quot; at any position of the script, even outside of the blocks &quot;.INIT&quot; and &quot;.SEQUENCE&quot;. The include file can indeed contain these two keywords. Everything is possible because the instruction is used for the preprocessing. However, at the end, the script must have a <a href="#sect_struct">valid structure</a>.</p>
		<p>If you fall into recursive inclusions, a limit will apply.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_input">INPUT</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>By default, this instruction gets a number from the user. If you use the modifier "string", you get a chain of characters stored in <a href="#sect_defarrays">an array</a> starting from the position 1.</p>
		<p class="Center"><img class="NoBorder" src="input.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>The arguments are used to build the text which appears in the input dialog. The technical rules are the same than for the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>There are several outputs for the function:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The button validated by the user is stored in &quot;sys.popup&quot;. The button OK corresponds to the value &quot;sys.popup.yes&quot; and the button Cancel corresponds to the value &quot;sys.popup.cancel&quot;.
					<ul>
					<li><ins>Restriction</ins>: you should never use directly the integer value stored behind &quot;sys.popup.yes&quot;. It is dependent on the operating system.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Even if the user has clicked on the button OK, the input can be wrong. If there is no error, the variable &quot;sys.input&quot; is saved, else it is deleted. Therefore, you have to check for the existence of the variable with the instruction &quot;EXIST&quot; which updates the variable &quot;sys.result&quot;. If you used the modifier "string", you can test for the existence of the variable "sys.input[1]".</li>
				<li>If you prompt for a string (see below), the length of the input is stored in the variable "sys.input.length".</li>
			</ul>
		<p>For an integer, a complete validation can be written as follows:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">INPUT</span> <span class="SR_String">'Type a number :'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">EXIST</span> sys.input
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.popup = sys.popup.yes <span class="SR_Keyword">AND</span> sys.result
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You have chosen :'</span> sys.input
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You have typed a wrong number.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>For a string of characters, a complete validation can be written as follows. The length of the input is stored in the variable "sys.input.length".</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">INPUT</span> <span class="SR_String">'Type a string :'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">EXIST</span> sys.input[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>]
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.popup = sys.popup.yes <span class="SR_Keyword">AND</span> sys.result
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The string is saved in the array named "sys.input".'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'You have typed nothing.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_label">LABEL</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction is followed by an argument written in full text (on contrary to the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot; for example which follows specific rules). It performs no action but it is targetable by another instruction named &quot;<a href="#inst_goto">GOTO</a>&quot;. The finality is to create loops.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_leave">LEAVE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>By calling this instruction, the execution of the current script is stopped and the application is terminated. In GUI mode, if the script is modified, you will be prompted to save your changes.</p>
		<p>This is useful if you want to execute several scripts <a href="#para_cmdline">in batch</a>. You will probably need to use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_save">SAVE</a>&quot; to store the output of the log.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_pause">PAUSE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction is used when the execution of a scripted roulette needs to be temporarily suspended the time that the user clicks on a button (GUI mode) or presses a key (console mode).</p>
		<p>This instruction is not used to break or stop the execution of the script. You have respectively the instructions &quot;<a href="#inst_break">BREAK</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#inst_stop">STOP</a>&quot; for that purpose.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_plot">PLOT</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>By calling this instruction, you enable or disable the storage of the evolution of your cash and credit each time you bet. In other words, the update of the graph is suspended but the storage of the history still continues.</p>
		<p>As there is no user interface in console mode, the relevance of the instruction is limited but it doesn't generate any warning.</p>
		<p>The argument is an expression. You can use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&quot;sys.true&quot; and &quot;sys.false&quot;.</li>
				<li>&quot;ON&quot; or &quot;OFF&quot; directly which are translated into their corresponding Boolean value.</li>
				<li>Their use is strongly recommended.</li>
				<li>A mathematical expression: the active status corresponds to the value 1, all other values are equal to &quot;OFF&quot;.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>To activate the plot (which is the case by default), the following instructions are equivalent:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">ON</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> sys.true
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>/<span class="SR_Numeric">10</span></p>
		<p>To deactivate the plot, the following instructions are equivalent.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">OFF</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> sys.false
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PLOT</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span></p>
		<p>You can access the status of the plot by reading the variable &quot;sys.plot&quot;.</p>
		<p>If you don't need the plot, it is a good idea to call &quot;PLOT OFF&quot; to save some memory and increase the
performances.</p>
		<p>As you can't assign directly a value to a variable from the domain &quot;sys&quot; by using the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_set">SET</a>&quot;, this new instruction is available.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_popup">POPUP</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI mode only. Equivalent to &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot; in console mode.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction displays a text directly in a popup window. The objective is to have a higher level of attention from the user.</p>
		<p class="Center"><img class="NoBorder" src="message.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>The arguments are used to build the message. The rules are the same than for the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot;. When you use modifiers to classify the popup, the icon will be adapted accordingly.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">POPUP</span> error <span class="SR_String">'An error occurred.'</span></p>
		<p>The execution of the script is suspended while the message is not validated by clicking on &quot;OK&quot;. No other choice is possible.</p>
		<p><ins>Restriction</ins>: it is recommended that you don't use this instruction in a <a href="#sect_defloops">loop</a>, else you will have some concerns to stop the execution of the script.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">POPUP</span> <span class="SR_String">'Click OK to spin'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SPIN</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">POPUP</span> <span class="SR_String">'The landed number is'</span> game.landed.number</p>

	<h2 id="inst_progress">PROGRESS</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI mode only.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction accepts a mathematical expression as a parameter. The resulting value must be greater or equal than zero, and lower or equal than 100. The given percentage will move the progress bar at the bottom of the main GUI frame:</p>
		<p class="Center"><img class="NoBorder" src="progress.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>Moreover, every 5%, you will be allowed to suspend the execution of the script by clicking on the button entitled &quot;Stop&quot;.</p>
		<p>If you want to give the exact value of the progression, you may also use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_status">STATUS</a>&quot;.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_random">RANDOM</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No or 1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction generates a random number which must not be mixed up with the spin of the ball. Indeed, this generator is independent.</p>
		<p>When you provide no argument to the instruction, the random number is generated to match the straight numbers that you can play on the table.</p>
		<p>When you specify one composite argument, the expression is evaluated and a random number is returned in the interval starting from zero and ending by the found result.</p>
		<p>The random number is stored in the variable &quot;sys.random&quot;.</p>
		<p><ins>Restriction</ins>: the HTTP generators cannot generate free numbers because the current pool is already put in cache for the game play. Requesting a random number may not fit the terms of service if single connections are triggered.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'A playable number between 0 to 36 by default:'</span> sys.random

<span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>^<span class="SR_Numeric">16</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'A number between 0 and 65536:'</span> sys.random</p>

	<h2 id="inst_randomize">RANDOMIZE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction aims to define the initial status for the pseudo-random number generator. As it is called once when the application is launched, you don't need to call the instruction in normal conditions.</p>
		<p>It is not recommended that you use the instruction in a sequence. Indeed, it must be called once at the startup of the script. Calling the instruction too often comes with no added value.</p>
		<p>Two cases are identified to use the instruction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you need to revert back the generators to their initial status with instruction &quot;<a href="#para_clear_random">CLEAR RANDOM</a>&quot;, you must have called the instruction &quot;RANDOMIZE&quot; at the beginning of the script. Refer to the demo files for one example.</li>
				<li>If you run your script several times with the help of the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_restart">RESTART</a>&quot;, it may be interesting to shuffle the generators to get new series of numbers, and not only the following numbers of the initial series.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2 id="inst_refresh">REFRESH</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI only.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction is used in very particular cases to solve the issue described in <a href="#para_noresponse">this section</a>.</p>
		<p>It is recommended that you don't call it too often. A good rate is 100 times per execution of the script. However, if
		you add a complex condition before the call to this instruction, the time of its processing may be higher that the time you lose by calling the instruction &quot;REFRESH&quot;.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_restart">RESTART</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No or 1 argument.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="para_restart">RESTART</h3>
			<p>When you call this instruction with no parameter, the current sequence stops and the script is restarted. The variables are kept to their current status.</p>
			<p>The section &quot;.INIT&quot; is not processed again when the instruction &quot;RESTART&quot; is called.</p>
			<p>When the script is restarted, you have the possibility to stop the execution of the script by clicking on the button entitled &quot;Stop&quot;.</p>
			<p>There is no other way to restart the script. This instruction is a complement to &quot;<a href="#inst_break">BREAK</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#inst_stop">STOP</a>&quot;.</p>

		<h3 id="para_restart_sequence">RESTART SEQUENCE</h3>
			<p>When you call &quot;RESTART&quot; with the keyword &quot;SEQUENCE&quot; as a parameter, you simply restart the current sequence. The instruction is similar to the following script but is really more efficient:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">LABEL</span> start
    <span class="SR_Comment">"Do something"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">GOTO</span> start</p>
			<p>This variant also gives you the possibility to stop the execution of the script by clicking on the button entitled &quot;Stop&quot;.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_rollback">ROLLBACK</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction does the contrary job of the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_backup">BACKUP</a>&quot;. All the variables will be restored, including the current bet, the cash on hand and the amount of the credit line.</p>
		<p>You can't restore the data if you have not saved them at least once before with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_backup">BACKUP</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>The log of the spins and the status of the pseudorandom number generator can't be restored with this instruction.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_save">SAVE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console if you have enabled the <a href="#sect_compile">extended features</a>.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="para_save_distribution">SAVE DISTRIBUTION</h3>
			<p>This instruction aims to show on a picture how the numbers are distributed on a square. Each generated number is assigned to a target pixel which is immediately set to white. It helps to determine if there are abandoned zones. If you spin too much, a normally distributed algorithm will generated a white square.</p>
			<p>When you call the instruction, the current pseudo-random number generator is used and the generated picture is created in the current working directory under the name &quot;scripted_roulette_distribution.bmp&quot;.</p>
			<p>Each PRNG has its own distribution. You can refer to the <a href="#sect_randomness">corresponding section</a> to see the results.</p>

		<h3 id="para_save_history">SAVE HISTORY</h3>
			<p>This instruction saves the history of the spins into a file located in the current working directory and named as &quot;scripted_roulette_history.csv&quot;.</p>
			<p>If you want to reset the data involved in the save, you can call &quot;<a href="#para_clear_history">CLEAR HISTORY</a>&quot;.</p>
			<p>The output file is composed of several columns:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Field</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Spin</td>
					<td>Unique identifier of the spin</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bet</td>
					<td>Amount of the bet for 1 counter</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Stake</td>
					<td>Total amount on the table</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Landed number</td>
					<td>Number given by the wheel</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Win</td>
					<td>Flag telling if you won</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Gain</td>
					<td>Amount that you earned for the round</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cash</td>
					<td>Resulting cash on hand</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Credit</td>
					<td>Resulting credit on hand</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Net result</td>
					<td>Total money that you won/lost from the beginning of the game</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

		<h3 id="para_save_hotmap">SAVE HOTMAP</h3>
			<p>This instruction is similar to &quot;<a href="#para_save_distribution">SAVE DISTRIBUTION</a>&quot; but the logic is different. The PRNG is triggered millions of times and the target pixel corresponding to the landed number is progressively increased in terms of grey intensity.</p>
			<p>&quot;Bad&quot; generators will make a black and white picture because some numbers will never land. If the generated picture is looking like a malfunctioning television set, there is a great chance that the luminosity is distributed according to a normal curve. In such case, you can generate many numbers from a big range.</p>
			<p>When you call the instruction, the current pseudo-random number generator is used and the generated picture is created in the current working directory under the name &quot;scripted_roulette_hotmap.bmp&quot;.</p>
			<p>Each PRNG has its own hot map. You can refer to the <a href="#sect_randomness">corresponding section</a> to see the
results.</p>

		<h3 id="para_save_log">SAVE LOG</h3>
			<p>This instruction saves the content of the log (whatever the messages are generated manually or not) into a file named &quot;scripted_roulette_log.csv&quot; and located in the current working directory.</p>
			<p>The output file is composed of two columns:</p>

			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Field</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Type</td>
					<td>Category of the message (error, warning...)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

	<h2 id="inst_set">SET</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument and 1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction is very important because it allows you to store some values in the memory. A &quot;variable&quot; is composed of a name and a value.</p>
		<p>First, to set a variable, you have to respect the <a href="#sect_defvars">naming convention</a> previously detailed.</p>
		<p>The first argument is the name of the target variable. From the second argument, you can assign a direct value or an expression to be evaluated. If an error occurs, the variable is neither created nor updated.</p>
		<p>You can assign only one value at a time:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 = user.var2 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"False!"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"OK"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var2 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"OK"</span></p>
		<p>To improve the general readability, you are allowed to use the sign &quot;=&quot; but it will be ignored. The two following lines are equivalent:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span></p>
		<p>There is no restriction to write spaces in the mathematical expression because all the parameters are interpreter as a whole after the sign &quot;=&quot;. The following lines are equivalent:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>+<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>+<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>+<span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 = <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span> + <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span> + <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span> + <span class="SR_Numeric">4</span></p>
		<p>Starting from the version 0.2, the spaces are allowed in the first argument if you use the sign &quot;=&quot;. This is especially interesting to improve the readability of the arrays defined with imbricated expressions:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span> + <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] = <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"OK"</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.array[<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span> + <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>] <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span> <span class="SR_Comment">"KO"</span></p>
		<p>To remove a variable, you can use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_unset">UNSET</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>To test the existence of a variable, you can use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_exist">EXIST</a>&quot;. But from a general point of view, you have several other ways to handle it:</p>
			<ul><li>Pay attention to the mathematical facts:</li></ul>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.value = -<span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> user.value &lt;= <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Cannot calculate the logarithm.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Result ='</span> ln(user.value)
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<ul><li>Use the default values:</li></ul>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.value = (user.strictly.positive.variable)
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> user.value &lt;= <span class="SR_Numeric">0</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'There is obviously a problem'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> user.value
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
			<ul><li>Use the return codes:</li></ul>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">INPUT</span> <span class="SR_String">'Give me a value:'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> sys.popup != sys.popup.yes
        <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'I will not define any value.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ELSE</span>
        <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.value = sys.input
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>
		<p>Starting from the version 0.2, you can play with the arrays in order to define several values under the name technical game. Please read the <a href="#sect_defarrays">dedicated section</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_show">SHOW</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 argument.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="para_show_algorithm">SHOW ALGORITHM</h3>
			<p>This instruction shows the name of the PRNG currently in use.</p>
			<p>You can use another generator by changing the value of &quot;<a href="#para_sysvars">sys.algorithm</a>&quot; with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_set">SET</a>&quot;.</p>

		<h3 id="para_show_distribution">SHOW DISTRIBUTION</h3>
			<p>The objective of this instruction is to spin a huge amount of times to verify that each number has a relatively equal probability to land.</p>
			<p>The output is given a standard deviation in order that you can <a href="#para_algorithms">compare the different algorithms</a>.</p>
			<p>The function is not available for HTTP providers of random numbers because the instruction is too intensive and will exhaust your quota.</p>

		<h3 id="para_show_layout">SHOW LAYOUT</h3>
			<p>The French, American and Mexican roulettes don't have the same layout. For example, the order of the numbers is not the same, and the number of zeros is different.</p>
			<p>This instruction shows the numbers that you can read clock-wise.</p>

		<h3 id="para_show_memory">SHOW MEMORY</h3>
			<p>This instruction dumps the content of the currently known variables.</p>
			<p>In GUI mode, it is useless because you already have a tab containing such a view. However, in console mode, the instruction is very useful to check the stored values.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SHOW</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">MEMORY</span></p>
			<p>The instruction generates many lines in the log. Consequently, it is advised to not call it too often.</p>

		<h3 id="para_show_money">SHOW MONEY</h3>
			<p>This instruction displays the current amounts of money involved in the game:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Current cash</li>
				<li>Credit line</li>
				<li>Net result</li>
				<li>Current stakes</li>
				<li>Value of 1 counter</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="para_show_script">SHOW SCRIPT</h3>
			<p>For debugging purposes, you can display the scripted roulette as it is known in the memory. You will see that the script is minimal to be processed as fast as possible.</p>
			<p>Some instructions like &quot;<a href="#inst_cbet">CBET</a>&quot; are macros: they are preprocessed when the script is loaded. In such case, it is not a problem if the loaded script is different. The results at the end are the same.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">CBET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">12</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SHOW</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">SCRIPT</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_show_seed">SHOW SEED</h3>
			<p>As <a href="#sect_randomness">detailed previously</a>, each pseudo-random number generator is fed with an initial value X<sub>0</sub> determined from another value called &quot;seed&quot;.</p>
			<p>This instruction shows the seeds respectively used for the ball and the wheel.</p>

		<h3 id="para_show_sequences">SHOW SEQUENCES</h3>
			<p>This instruction is similar to &quot;<a href="#para_show_script">SHOW SCRIPT</a>&quot;. It displays the content of the sequences like they are loaded.</p>

		<h3 id="para_show_table_bets">SHOW TABLE and SHOW BETS</h3>
			<p>When you bet on some numbers with &quot;<a href="#inst_bet">BET</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="#inst_cbet">CBET</a>&quot;, you come to the point that you don't know anymore what the active bets are.</p>
			<p>By calling this new instruction, you are told the stakes on the table.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">BET</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">1</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">2</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">35</span>-<span class="SR_Numeric">36</span> red
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SHOW</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">BETS</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_slap">SLAP</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This command is mostly a joke that you can use when something gets wrong and if the root cause is identified. You have to provide an argument written in full text with no apostrophe.</p>
		<p>This command:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SLAP</span> me</p>
		<p>...will display the following text:</p>
		<p class="Code">Scripted Roulette slaps me around a bit with a large trout.</p>
		<p>For a more intellectual explanation, please refer to:</p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Whacking_with_a_wet_trout" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Whacking_with_a_wet_trout</a></li></ul>

	<h2 id="inst_spin">SPIN</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No or several composite arguments.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Once you have bet on the numbers you want with the instructions &quot;<a href="#inst_bet">BET</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="#inst_cbet">CBET</a>&quot;, you have to spin the ball. The instruction validates the current stakes, calculates the gains/losses, updates you money on hand, makes some statistics and logs the trace.</p>
		<p>If you give no argument to the instruction, the spin is done according to the current layout of the wheel. However, if you specify an expression, it is evaluated and its result becomes the landed number directly (the ball is spun anyway but the result is overridden).</p>
		<p>Based on the landed number, some variables are updated among the domain &quot;game.landed&quot; (read more in <a href="#para_landedvars">this section</a>).</p>

		<h3 id="para_spin_alt">Alternative use</h3>
			<p>If you generate a random number with instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_random">RANDOM</a>&quot;, you will have no associated information. Therefore, to find the color for example, you can write:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">RANDOM</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SPIN</span> sys.random</p>
			<p>However, this informative spin will be logged. To cancel this spin from the log, you have to call <a href="#para_clear_last_history">another instruction</a>:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">CLEAR</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">LAST</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">HISTORY</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_stat">STAT</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Each time you spin the ball with the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_spin">SPIN</a>&quot;, the history is saved and after some time, you are able to make some interesting statistics. They are generated on demand with the instruction &quot;STAT&quot; because it is time-consuming.</p>
		<p>The output of the function is the update of the statistical variables included in the domain &quot;stat&quot;. A detailed list is given in <a href="#para_statvars">this section</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_status">STATUS</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI mode only. Equivalent to &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot; in console mode.</li>
				<li>1 composite argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction displays a text in the status bar of the main window.</p>
		<p class="Center"><img src="status.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>The arguments are used to build the message. The rules are the same than for the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_write">WRITE</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>When you call the instruction, it is possible that you will not see it immediately. Indeed, when a script is running, the refresh of the window is not the priority and if the window doesn't respond, it will become white. To solve this issue, you have to use <a href="#para_noresponse">special commands</a> which will trigger the processing of the pending refreshes.</p>
		<p>If you also use the instruction &quot;<a href="#inst_progress">PROGRESS</a>&quot; to inform about the status of the script, it is recommended that you write it after &quot;STATUS&quot;.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.progress = (your calculation)
    <span class="SR_Keyword">STATUS</span> <span class="SR_String">'Progress is'</span> user.progress <span class="SR_String">'%'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">PROGRESS</span> user.progress</p>
		<p>If you use the instruction &quot;STATUS&quot; to display a progression, there is a great chance that it is located in a loop. To avoid the display of too many messages when the script is executed in console mode, it is safer to surround the instruction by the following condition:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">IF</span> <span class="SR_Keyword">NOT</span> sys.console
        <span class="SR_Keyword">STATUS</span> <span class="SR_String">'Progression :'</span> user.progress <span class="SR_String">'%'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">ENDIF</span></p>

	<h2 id="inst_stop">STOP</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A script is a succession of sequences. When the instruction &quot;STOP&quot; is called, the execution of the whole script is stopped.</p>

	<h2 id="inst_time">TIME</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.2.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>No argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>If your scripted roulette takes some time to be executed, you may leave your seat and want to know later how much time it took.</p>
		<p>You will have to call the instruction twice :</p>
			<ol>
				<li>At the beginning to save the time stamp,</li>
				<li>At the end to save the new time stamp and to calculate the elapsed time.</li>
			</ol>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">TIME</span>
    <span class="SR_Comment">"... a long task ..."</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">TIME</span></p>
		<p>When the instruction is called, the current date and time are displayed, unless you use the symbol &quot;<a href="#sect_hidew">@</a>&quot; in front of the instruction. When the instruction is called a second time (and more), the difference of time is displayed and this cannot be disabled. In other words, the time span is always the one between two calls to the instruction. To reset the time stamp, you must use the instruction &quot;<a href="#para_clear_time">CLEAR TIME</a>&quot;.</p>
		<p>The format of the time stamp is : (name of the day) (day) (month) (year), (hour):(minute):(second)</p>
		<p>The format of the elapsed time is : ((days)) (hours):(minutes):(seconds).(milliseconds)</p>

	<h2 id="inst_unset">UNSET</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 or several arguments.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction has the contrary effect than &quot;<a href="#inst_set">SET</a>&quot;: it deletes the existing variables provided that you have the rights for it. Indeed, the variables that you can't change are also protected against the deletion.</p>
		<p>The arguments are the names of the variables to delete:</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.var1
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> user.var2 user.var3
</p>
		<p>If you use the keyword &quot;ALL&quot;, then you delete all the changeable variables, including &quot;game.cash&quot; and &quot;game.credit&quot;. Some of the important generated variables will then reappear with a default value.</p>
		<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">UNSET</span> all</p>

	<h2 id="inst_write">WRITE</h2>
		<p>Characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction in the version 0.1.</li>
				<li>Supported in GUI and Console.</li>
				<li>1 or several composite arguments.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This instruction aims to write some information in the log. This information can later be exported with &quot;<a href="#para_save_log">SAVE LOG</a>&quot; or from the GUI interface.</p>

		<h3 id="para_write_syntax">Syntax</h3>
			<p>Quite everything can be converted into a string. For the arguments of the instruction, you can provide strings, numbers, variables, expressions and keywords.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'Hello!'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">5</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> game.cash
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>*game.cash+<span class="SR_Numeric">4</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> space</p>
			<p>The instruction accepts several arguments at a time, but each argument is evaluated independently and concatenated at the end. The consequence is that you are <strong>not</strong> allowed to use spaces in the mathematical expressions. Look at the following example:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span>+<span class="SR_Numeric">3</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_Numeric">2</span> + <span class="SR_Numeric">3</span></p>
			<p>The concatenation automatically adds a space between each argument in the final string.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The message'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The'</span> <span class="SR_String">'message'</span></p>
			<p>The accumulated leading and trailing spaces are removed when the message is displayed. To keep the spaces, you must add it explicitely with the keyword "space".</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> space space space <span class="SR_String">'...'</span></p>
			<p>When an expression cannot be evaluated, it is returned as if it was never calculated.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.var1 = <span class="SR_Numeric">10</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> user.var1+user.var2</p>
			<p>In a string, you may want to use an apostrophe. In order that it doesn't break the logic and the syntax highlighting, you have to repeat the apostrophe. Scripted Roulette will then consider the apostrophe once.</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'I can'</span><span class="SR_String">'t believe it.'</span></p>
			<p>Because you are playing numbers at the roulette, you don't normally need floating-point calculations. By default, whatever the value of the variable, the display is always truncated. To force the consideration of the decimal part, you have to use a <a href="#sect_numfmt">special modifier</a> at the beginning of the expression:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">SET</span> user.pi = <span class="SR_Numeric">3.1415926531</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> user.pi
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> f:user.pi</p>
			<p><a href="#sect_numfmt">Another modifier</a> can be used to display the character associated to a number:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> <span class="SR_String">'The 50th character is'</span> c:<span class="SR_Numeric">50</span></p>

		<h3 id="para_write_msg">Message type</h3>
			<p>When you write to the log, you have to specify the criticality of the message. By default, it is simple information.</p>
			<p>To change the type of the message, you have to use a keyword written near the instruction:</p>

			<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Modifier</th>
					<th>Category</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>Information</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>warning</td>
					<td>Warning</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>error</td>
					<td>Error</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>debug</td>
					<td>Debugging</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>The modifiers can be called as follows:</p>
			<p class="Code"><span class="SR_Keyword">.SEQUENCE</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span>         <span class="SR_String">'This is a normal message.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> warning <span class="SR_String">'This is a warning message.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> error   <span class="SR_String">'This is an error message.'</span>
    <span class="SR_Keyword">WRITE</span> debug   <span class="SR_String">'This is a debug message.'</span></p>

            Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

      Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

      NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
      &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.</p>

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

      Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!</p>
